# dictapi

This application implements a very simple English-Spanish dictionary over an HTTP REST JSON API.

The stack is based on Python3 (and Django) and the database used is Sqlite for simplicity.

My assumptions:
 * A word may have more than one translation;
 * The amount of possible translations a word can have is only a few and does not need paginated listing;
 * I decided to not return `201 Created` after creating a new translation because this resource has no URI in this tiny application;

## Installing and running the application

Clone the repository then run the following commands:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python dictapi/manage.py migrate
$ python dictapi/manage.py runserver
```

The application should get running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dictionary`.

## Adding new words to dictionary

`POST /api/v1/dictionary`

For adding new words to dictionary, send a `POST` request with a JSON payload containing `en_word` and `es_word` fields as shown in the following example:

```console
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dictionary -d '{"en_word": "car", "es_word": "auto"}'
```

## Getting translations

`GET /api/v1/dictionary/:language/:word`

For getting a translation we should do a `GET` request passing a `word` and `language` as parameters in URI. For `language` we have two options `en` for English and `es` for Spanish.

```console
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dictionary/en/car
  {
    "meta": {
      "lang": "en",
      "word": "car",
      "entries": 1
    },
    "translations": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "translation": "auto"
      }
    ]
  }
```

----

## Deleting translations

`DELETE /api/v1/dictionary/:id`

To delete a dictionary entry just send a `DELETE` request with `id` of the Ã­tem that should be deleted, as shown in the example below:

```console
$ curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dictionary/1
```
